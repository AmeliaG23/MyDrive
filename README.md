## Project Overview

**MyDrive** is a POC mobile application designed to track journeys, monitor driving behavior, and provide users with safety scores and potential insurance discounts based on their driving patterns.

This project is developed using **React Native** and **Expo**, and is intended to demonstrate Level 6 QA practices including functional testing, modular architecture, and user-centric design.

The database has been initialised with 10 example users (1-10), and they can be accessed with the following credentials:
**Username:** user1

**Password:** Password1!

## Key Features & Purposes

1. **Journey Tracking**

   - Tracks driving routes using GPS location.
   - Records sensor data from accelerometer and gyroscope.
   - Calculates journey metrics including speed, distance, braking, and cornering.

2. **Safety Scoring System**

   - Calculates a 30-day average safety score based on recorded journeys.
   - Provides feedback to improve driving behavior.

3. **Car Insurance Discount Eligibility**

   - Determines eligibility for a discount if the user **consistently driving and recording journeys for a year**.
   - Generates a code for users who are eligible.

4. **Mobile Sensor Integration**

   - Collects telematics data to measure driving behavior.
   - Monitors phone usage while driving.

5. **User Interface**

   - Only displays first journey score after the user has **recorded over 400 miles in the last 60 days**.
   - Displays journeys and scores.
   - Includes a doughnut chart to visualise 30-day average scores.
   - Modal shows discount information and reference code.

6. **Testing**
   - Unit tests using **Jest**.

## Getting Started

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mydrive.git
cd mydrive
```

## Requirements

Before running the project, it requires the following:

- **npm** (comes with Node.js) or **yarn**
- **Expo Go** app on your mobile device (for iOS or Android)
- A code editor- e.g., **VS Code**

### Running the App

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

Once everything is installed run:
```bash
npx expo start
```
When the QR code is visible in the terminal, type **s** to switch to Expo Go. Then scan the **new** QR code with your phone camera and the app will load in Expo Go.

## Notes & Warnings

- **Physical Device Required**:  
  Tracking features will **not** work in the Expo Go simulator.  
  You must run the project on a **physical device** to enable journey tracking.

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard layout with organised folders for easy maintenance.

## Testing

This project includes **unit tests** to ensure reliability and maintainability. The tests are written using **Jest**.

### Location of Tests

- All test files are stored inside the `__tests__/` folders.

### Running the Tests

To execute the test suite, run:

```bash
npm test
```

or with yarn:

```bash
yarn test
```

To generate a coverage report, run:

```bash
npm test -- --coverage
```

This will output a summary in the console.


## Acknowledgements

This project was developed as part of the **Major Project (Level 6)** module with **QA**.

I would like to acknowledge the following:

- **QA Tutors** â€“ for their guidance, feedback, and support throughout the project.
- **Expo & React Native Communities** â€“ for providing extensive documentation, open-source libraries, and forums that helped in solving development challenges.
- **Third-Party Libraries** used in the project (React Navigation, Recharts, Safe Area Context, etc.) that enabled rapid development.
